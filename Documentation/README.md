# Green Audit Microservice MVP - User-Friendly Launch Package 
 
**Welcome to the User-Friendly Launch Package for the Green Audit Microservice MVP!** 
 
This package contains all the code, documentation, and instructions you need to deploy and validate the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Green Audit AI microservice. 
 
**What is the Green Audit Microservice MVP?** 
 
The Green Audit Microservice MVP is a simple web application that allows users to upload a screenshot or image of a shopping cart or product.  Using AI, the app analyzes the image and provides: 
 
*   **Eco Score:**  An AI-assessed score indicating how eco-friendly the products in the image are (e.g., "ECO-FRIENDLY", "NOT ECO-FRIENDLY"). 
*   **AI Analysis Description:** A text description generated by AI explaining what is in the image and the AI's assessment. 
*   **Sustainable Alternatives (Future Feature):**  A placeholder section (currently non-functional in this MVP) to suggest eco-friendly alternative products (intended for future affiliate monetization). 
*   **"Get Detailed Report" Button (Future Feature):** A disabled button (placeholder) for a future premium "Detailed Report" feature. 
 
**Purpose of this Launch Package:** 
 
This User-Friendly Launch Package is designed to make it as easy as possible for you to: 
 
1.  **DEPLOY** the Green Audit Microservice MVP as a live web application. 
2.  **VALIDATE** the MVP in the real world by sharing it with potential users and gathering feedback and metrics. 
3.  **TEST** the core functionality and assess user interest in the concept. 
4.  **Potentially start generating initial income** through affiliate links (future monetization - currently placeholder). 
5.  **Learn and Iterate:** Gather data from the validation phase to inform future development and improvements of the Green Audit Microservice.

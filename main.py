#!/usr/bin/env python3

# This is a basic template for main.py.
# You can adapt it to your specific needs.

# --- Import Statements ---
# You'll likely need to import modules to use external functionalities.
# Common modules include:
# - os: For interacting with the operating system (e.g., file paths, environment variables)
# - sys: For system-specific parameters and functions (e.g., command-line arguments)
# - time: For time-related functions (e.g., pausing execution, measuring time)
# - datetime: For working with dates and times in a more structured way
# - json: For working with JSON data
# - requests: For making HTTP requests (if your script interacts with web APIs)
# - Your own modules: If you've created other Python files with functions/classes

import os
import sys
import time

# --- Function Definitions ---
# It's good practice to organize your code into functions.
# You can define functions for specific tasks your script needs to perform.

def greet_user():
    """
    This function greets the user. You can customize this.
    """
    username = os.getlogin() # Get the current username (might not work in all environments)
    print(f"Hello, {username}! Welcome to main.py.")

def process_data(input_file):
    """
    This is a placeholder function for data processing.
    Replace this with your actual data processing logic.

    Args:
        input_file (str): Path to the input file to process.
    """
    print(f"Starting to process data from: {input_file}")
    time.sleep(1) # Simulate some processing time
    print("Data processing in progress...")
    time.sleep(2) # Simulate more processing time
    print("Data processing completed (placeholder).")
    # In a real script, you would:
    # 1. Read data from input_file
    # 2. Perform operations on the data
    # 3. Potentially write results to an output file or display them

def main():
    """
    This is the main function where your script's logic will reside.
    It's the entry point when you run 'python main.py'.
    """
    print("--- Starting main.py ---")

    greet_user() # Call the greet_user function

    # --- Example: Handling Command Line Arguments ---
    # You can access command-line arguments passed to your script using sys.argv.
    # sys.argv is a list where:
    # - sys.argv[0] is the script name itself ("main.py")
    # - sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], ... are the arguments passed after the script name

    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        input_filename = sys.argv[1] # Assume the first argument is the input file path
        print(f"Input file provided: {input_filename}")
        process_data(input_filename) # Call the data processing function
    else:
        print("No input file specified as a command-line argument.")
        print("Please run the script like: python main.py <input_file_path>")

    print("--- Ending main.py ---")

# --- Main Execution Block ---
# This ensures that the 'main()' function is called only when the script is run directly.
# If this script is imported as a module into another script, 'main()' will not be executed automatically.
if __name__ == "__main__":
